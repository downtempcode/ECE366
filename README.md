How to run the MIPS program to get the nth Fibonacci number for a given n:
Open our file using MARS, then locate this line in the .data section of our code:
n: .word 8    # Change this to any desired input value
Change 8 to the value of n you want to compute, then assemble and run.
After execution, open the Registers pane and look at register $v0 â€” this holds the final result.
